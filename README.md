# Food Lion - Load All To Card

## Introduction

This is a Chrome extension that adds a "Load All To Card" button to the Food
Lion [MVP Coupons Center](https://www.foodlion.com/coupons/). The Javascript
action on this button will click on all the coupons in one shot, adding all of
them to the card.

## Installation

git clone this repository to your local disk or download the zip file and extract.

Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions). You'll need to enable
developer mode in order to load an unpacked extension.

Click on "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the folder in which you
cloned or extracted the source files. Select this folder to load the extension.

## Usage

Once you've installed and enabled this extension, go to the Food Lion MVP
Coupons Center and find the "Load All To Card" button on the top left corner.
Click on it and it will load all the coupons to your card.

Note: this button works only on coupons that are currently visible on the
page. If you have a lot of coupons to load, you will need to scroll down to
make the Food Lion website display more coupons.
